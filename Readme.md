# ASPxUploadControl - How to convert a binary image to a base64 string


<p>The data URI scheme is an URI scheme (the Uniform Resource Identifier scheme) that provides a way to include data in-line in web pages as if they were external resources. Data URIs are a form of Uniform Resource Locators, although they do not in fact remotely locate anything. Instead, the resource data is contained within a URL string itself as a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Base64"><u>base64-encoded</u></a> string. This saves the browser from having to make additional HTTP requests to external resources, and can thus increase page loading speed. </p><br />
<p>This online example allows you to upload an image using the ASPxUploadControl and convert the image into a base64 encoded data URI for embedding images into html or css. </p><br />
<p>Your image elements will look as follows: </p>

```html
<img src="your_image_bytes_in_base_64" />
```
